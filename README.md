# radio-song-checker
This script checked over the Radio Panel Database of songs looking for Spotify Karaoke metadata and tried to replace it with the correct metadata.

The script would search the database of songs looking for songs with karaoke metadata from Spotify if it found it, it would search spotify via Radiopanel for new metadata if it could find correct metadata, it would replace it else it would send us a message that it couldn't find it.

The script logged everything it did in a log file.
